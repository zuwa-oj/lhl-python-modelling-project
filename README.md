# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)
Project to build a statistical model to derive insights on the relationship between the number of bikes in a chosen location and the characteristics of Places of interest in the location.

## Process
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)
Step 1: Connection to CityBikes API and exploration of the structure of the API in order to retrieve Bike Station latitude, longitude, and number of bikes for chosen location.
Step 2: Connection to Foursquare API and exploration of the structure of the API in order to retrieve information for restaurants and bars for each of the bike stations from step 1.
Step 3: Connection to Yelp API and exploration of the structure of the API in order to retrieve information for restaurants and bars for each of the bike stations from step 1.
Step 4: Joining of data from step 1, step 2 and step 3 into a new DataFrame.
Step 5: Use of data visualization to explore the data.
Step 6: Creation of SQLite database to store the data collected.
Step 7: Building of regression model to show relationship between number of bikes and places of interest in the location.
Step 8: Interpretation of results and presentation of findings.


## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
Project timeframe was shortened due to repeated Yelp API Request failed: Status code: 429. This was due to request restrictions on the Yelp API

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
Find more POIs to enrich the dataset to get a better model.
